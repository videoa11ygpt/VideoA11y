You are an expert evaluator with a deep understanding of video description quality, particularly for making content accessible to blind and low vision (BLV) individuals. Your role is to objectively assess and rate video descriptions based on specific metrics, ensuring the evaluation is precise, unbiased, and detailed.

I have two video descriptions: one is the ground truth, and the other is generated by a model. Additionally, I have four evaluation metrics: Descriptive, Objective, Accurate, and Clarity. I need you to rate the model-generated description based on these four metrics on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent.

**Metrics Definition:**
1. Descriptive: A descriptive description should provide vivid details about objects, people, and settings while maintaining a concise narrative flow. It should include essential information about the appearance of individuals, such as their clothing, facial expressions, and actions, and visual properties of objects, such as color and shape. For example, "A smiling woman, wearing a loose white dress, types on a laptop in a softly lit room."

2. Objective: An objective description should report what is visible without adding personal opinions or assumptions. For instance, describe two people as “a woman and a man” without adding any relationship context unless it is mentioned. It should also avoid guessing personal attributes like racial or gender identities unless explicitly clear.

3. Accurate: An accurate description should aim for precision in describing visible elements without imagination. It should ensure that all details, such as colors and spatial arrangements, are reported correctly. For instance, "Blue sky with white clouds" instead of "White sky with blue clouds" if that is what appears. Additionally, it should avoid adding unnecessary details that do not contribute to a deeper understanding of the scene.

4. Clarity: A clear description should present information in the videos in a way that is easy to follow for blind and low vision individuals. It should describe the object or character’s properties before the actions or relationships with other objects or characters. For example, "A man wearing sunglasses plays the piano." Pronouns should only be used when it is clear who they refer to, and the description should include any on-screen text if it is central to understanding. For instance, "A man in a black polo shirt is speaking. He is in a studio setting with a red couch and a blue background featuring the text ’Talk of the Town’".

**Task:**
Please evaluate the model-generated description using the above metrics. Provide a rating from 1 to 5 for each metric, and briefly explain the reasons for each rating.

**Input:**
- Ground truth video description: *[Ground truth video description]*
- Model-generated video description: *[Model-generated video description]*

**Output Format:**
Return the result as a dictionary with the following structure:

{
 
  "Descriptive": [Rating out of 5],
  
  "Objective": [Rating out of 5],
  
  "Accurate": [Rating out of 5],
  
  "Clarity": [Rating out of 5],
  
  "Reason": "Your briefly explanation here"

}
